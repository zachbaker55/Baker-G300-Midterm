In terms of theme, I was thinking something along the lines of a test chamber. I made the patrolling enemy a guard and the chasing enemies robots. I imagine the guard has locked the player into the test chamber with the robots, and the player needs to destroy the robots and escape the guard to succeed. The textures are metallic to fit into that theme.
